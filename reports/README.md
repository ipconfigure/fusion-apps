### Running locally
Run these commands to set up the documentation:

```
cd conf
npm install
node index.js
```

Then run `grunt monitor` to compile the documentation. When it finishes, open a new browser window and navigate to `localhost:8000`. We use [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to display the documentation.

### Documentation for previous releases
Previous releases and their documentation are available for [download](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/releases).
